## Tips on working 

#### Optimization is key

Start from an all encompassing text and then shorten and optimize further until
it is easily understood.

#### Consider impacts

Think of all possible impacts (negative and positive) with every motivation
you can think of before formulating a rule.

#### It is OK to make a mistakes (pun intended)

Errors should not be shunned nor hidden but simply corrected. This promotes
an open and transparent way of working on a specific task.

#### Avoid culturally relative terms

The use of words like good, bad and so on in a cultural way should be avoided
at all cost because they only convey meaning in a specific cultural circle.
