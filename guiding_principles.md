title: Guiding principles
---
## Goal
The goal of this manifesto is to create a form of society which relies not on their instincts but almost solely on logical reasoning.
The rules listed below should guide every statement made in the manifest.

## Rules
These properties should be respected by every statement in this project.
* Only materialistic values exist
* Everyone is equal

A Statement should only be added if the following is also valid:
* Is logically justifiable with the current understanding of nature (science).
* Does quantifiably more good than harm to all of humanity. (Must be provable through empirical evidence)

## Working principles
#### Optimization is key
Start from an all encompassing text and then shorten and optimize further until
it is easily understood.

#### Consider impacts
Think of all possible impacts (negative and positive) with every motivation you can think of before
formulating a rule.

#### It is ok to make a mistakes
Errors should not be shunned nor hidden but simply corrected. This promotes an open and transparent way
of working on a specific task.

#### Avoid culturaly relative terms
The use of words like good, bad and so on in a cultural way should be avoided at all cost
because they only convey meaning in a specific cultural circle.
