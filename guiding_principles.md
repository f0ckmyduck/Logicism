## Goal
The goal of this manifest is to create a fictional form of society which
gives all freedoms of expression which are valid to every person.

A freedom is only valid if it obeys the following principals:
* Is logically justifiable with the current understanding of nature (science).
* Does quantifiably more good than harm to all of humanity. (Must be provable through empirical evidence)

## Working principles
#### All rules should be explainable.
Every rule should have a base in a psychological observation.

#### Optimization is key
Start from an all encompassing text and then shorten and optimize further until
it is easily understood but still conveys the same meaning.

## Rules which must adhered to
* The most obvious solution is not always the optimal one
* Think of all possible impacts (negative and positive) with every motivation you can think of.
