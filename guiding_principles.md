## Goal
The goal of this manifest is to create a fictional form of society which
gives all freedoms of expression which adhere to the rule set to every person.

## Rules
* Is logically justifiable with the current understanding of nature (science).
* Does quantifiably more good than harm to all of humanity. (Must be provable through empirical evidence)

## Base
* Only materialistical value exists

## Working principles
#### All rules should be explainable.
Every rule should have a base in a psychological observation.

#### Optimization is key
Start from an all encompassing text and then shorten and optimize further until
it is easily understood but still conveys the same meaning.

#### Solutions
The most obvious solution is probably not always the optimal one.

#### Consider impacts
Think of all possible impacts (negative and positive) with every motivation you can think of before
formulating a rule.

#### It is ok to make mistakes
Mistakes should not be shunned nor hidden but simply corrected.
