title: Guiding principles

# Logicism

## Goal

The goal of this manifesto is to create a form of society which relies not
on their instincts but almost solely on logical reasoning.

The idea is that if you have a basic understanding of most scientific fields
you will be able to prove or reconstruct every rule or view in this manifesto
by your self.

## Rules

The rules listed below should guide every statement made in this manifesto.
* Only materialistic values exist
* Everyone is equal

A Statement should only be added if the following is also valid:
* Is logically justifiable with the current understanding of nature (science).
* Does quantifiably more good than harm to all of humanity. (Must be provable
through empirical evidence)
* Has to be derivable from and provable with a logical or psychological base.

## Tips on working 

#### Optimization is key

Start from an all encompassing text and then shorten and optimize further until
it is easily understood.

#### Consider impacts

Think of all possible impacts (negative and positive) with every motivation
you can think of before formulating a rule.

#### It is OK to make a mistakes (pun intended)

Errors should not be shunned nor hidden but simply corrected. This promotes
an open and transparent way of working on a specific task.

#### Avoid culturally relative terms

The use of words like good, bad and so on in a cultural way should be avoided
at all cost because they only convey meaning in a specific cultural circle.
