title: Guiding principles
---
## Goal
The goal of this manifest is to create a fictional form of society which
gives all freedoms of expression which adhere to the rule set to every person.

## Rules
* Is logically justifiable with the current understanding of nature (science).
* Does quantifiably more good than harm to all of humanity. (Must be provable through empirical evidence)

## Working principles
#### All rules should be explainable.
Every rule should only be a product of our current scientific understanding.

#### Optimization is key
Start from an all encompassing text and then shorten and optimize further until
it is easily understood but still conveys the same meaning.

#### Solutions
The most obvious solution is probably not always the optimal one.

#### Consider impacts
Think of all possible impacts (negative and positive) with every motivation you can think of before
formulating a rule.

#### It is ok to make a mistakes
Errors should not be shunned nor hidden but simply corrected. This promotes an open and transparent way
of working on a specific task.

#### Avoid cultural relative terms
The use of words like good, bad and so on in a cultural way should be avoided at all cost
because they only convey meaning in a specific cultural circle.
