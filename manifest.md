# General Topics
## Openness to new Ideas and concepts
We need to educate the youth to be open minded and not to ignore the standpoint
of another person just because it does not align with their world view.

The have to understand that the more worldviews a person understands and can
potentially take into consideration the better the solution they come up with is.

This needs to happen because only then will we be able to listen to each other in a discussion even
if the members views have almost nothing in common. I can also help others build upon seemingly absurd
ideas which could accelerate innovation.

## The meaning of words
The definition of a word should be split in two categories. One is the real objective meaning
and the other is the emotional attachment that the word caries in a specific cultural cycle.
Any words can therefore be used in any way as long as context is observed.

The use of a word should therefore not be shunned or outright banned just because it evokes some kind of emotion
when used in a specific cultural cycle. This should be because words are just constructs created to describe
a physical thing, an emotion or something else. We then attach a meaning afterwards using the memories we have of
others which used the word.

To conclude, not the word is the problem but the memory we associate with it.

# Schooling
To facilitate the new way of thinking one must ponder about how to educate the youth to respect each other and think openly and freely about their surroundings.

## Learning
Learning new things even outside of school should be rewarded and not punished.

#### Students interested in the subject
Currently most countries implement some form of standardization for learning progress and the testing of learned knowledge.
This effectively cripples students who want to go beyond the curriculum because the time, which could be used for self
improvement, is instead filled with repetitive and outdated learning methods.

To solve this the teacher should be able to identify a student interested in learning more than usual. They should not treat him
differently but give the opportunity to answer questions without considering the current curriculum.

#### Students *not* interested in the subject
The standardization coupled with coarse-grained grade systems further introduces another problem which is the hiding of the real performance of a student.

A good example of this behaviour is when a student gets a nearly negative grade in a specific subject but still passes the year. Using a peer review performance test
one would be able to assess that the student is not able to solve basic tasks with the knowledge gained from the subject but still passed the year.

This leads to a worse overall performance in the workplace if the specific skill learned in the subject in question should be used.

One solution would be to offer most subjects as optional. The chosen subjects should be remarked in their final report card. Of course the age at which this freedom is given
should be considered because a student could still be in a phase where he/she is not able to make accurate judgements about their future.
