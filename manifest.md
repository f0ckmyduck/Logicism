## Openness to new Ideas and concepts
We need to educate the youth to be open minded and not to ignore the standpoint
of another person just because it does not align with their world view.

The have to understand that the more worldviews a person understands and can
potentially take into consideration the better the solution they come up with is.

This needs to happen because only then will we be able to listen to each other in a discussion even
if the members views have almost nothing in common. I can also help others build upon seemingly absurd
ideas which could accelerate innovation.

## The meaning of words
The definition of a word should be split in two categories. One is the real objective meaning
and the other is the emotional attachment that the word caries in a specific cultural cycle.
Any words can therefore be used in any way as long as context is observed.

The use of a word should therefore not be shunned or outright banned just because it evokes some kind of emotion
when used in a specific cultural cycle. This should be because words are just constructs created to describe
a physical thing, an emotion or something else. We then attach a meaning afterwards using the memories we have of
others which used the word.

To conclude, not the word is the problem but the memory we associate with it.
