# Schooling
Currently a lot of schools and teachers encourage the learning of facts and facts only. This is problematic because these people
do not learn on how to use and manipulate things using these facts they are just taught that this knowledge exists and that you should remember it
for the next test.

To facilitate the new way of thinking one must ponder about how to educate the youth to respect each other and think openly and
freely about their surroundings.

## Learning performance
Learning new things even outside of school should be rewarded and not punished.

#### Students interested in the subject
Currently most countries implement some form of standardization for learning progress and the testing of learned knowledge.
This effectively cripples students who want to go beyond the curriculum because the time, which could be used for self
improvement, is instead filled with repetitive and outdated learning methods.

__Possible Solution:__
To solve this the teacher should be able to identify a student interested in learning more than usual. They should not treat him
differently but give the opportunity to answer questions without considering the current curriculum.

#### Students *not* interested in the subject
The standardization coupled with coarse-grained grade systems further introduces another problem which is the hiding of the real performance of a student.

A good example of this behaviour is when a student gets a nearly negative grade in a specific subject but still passes the year. Using
a peer review performance test one would be able to assess that the student is not able to solve basic tasks with the knowledge gained
from the subject but still passed the year.

This leads to a worse overall performance in the workplace if the specific skill learned in the subject in question should be used.

__Possible Solution:__
One solution would be to offer most subjects as optional. The chosen subjects should be remarked in their final report card. Of course
the age at which this freedom is given should be considered because a student could still be in a phase where he/she is not able to make
accurate judgements about their future.

__Expansion needed__

## Open-mindedness
We need to educate the youth to be open minded and not to ignore the standpoint
of another person just because it does not align with their world view.

They have to understand that the more worldviews a person understands and can
potentially take into consideration the better the solution they come up with is.

This needs to happen because only then will we be able to listen to each other in a discussion even
if the members views have almost nothing in common. It can also help others build upon seemingly absurd
ideas which could accelerate innovation.

__Possible Solution:__
There would need to be a cultural shift from embracing and nurturing stupidity to actively shun it.
However this would require either an almost dictatorship like style of brainwashing because the parents are still an influential source of
personality traits of the student or a lot of time (multiple generations).

## Dictatorship (Tyranny, ...)
We should also educate our students about the obvious sighs of a populist and how to deal with them.
More specifically to ignore all of their claims.

This should mitigate most effects of the standard populist method.

But there is a possibility that this will develop into a "Cat and Mouse game" so the taught methods
should grow with new populist tactics.

## Laziness
Students should also be taught to question everything (even things taught in school) to create a sense of uncertainty or even fear of "false
knowledge" which should drive them to do their own research.
