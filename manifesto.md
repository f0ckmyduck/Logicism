## Document specific markers

__Expansion needed__:
It marks the statement that came before it as incomplete. Either the
explanation, reasoning or assumptions are not finished yet.

__Possible solution__:
Could be one of the solutions to the problems above. It has to at least
fix one of the problems.

## Mathematical operators

All mathematical operators are taken from the C language.




# Education

* Most are taught in a way where knowledge is something that doesn't have to be understood
but can simply be attained.

```
It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry;
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need
of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.

The goal of this paragraph about education is to give students the opportunity to
learn intrinsically and in a fun way about topics that they want without the added bloat.
The other intent is to give them the power to transmit or discuss their knowledge with
others in a purely knowledge based discourse.

## Learning performance

* Learning differently or at a different pace is currently punished
passively by the move to standardized education systems.

### Differing cases

#### Uninterested courses

* In Austria for example there are most of the time no optional courses or
classes except in university.

This is a problem because if a class is not interesting the learning performance
of this student will go down. And if the performance sinks to a minimum the time
spent in class is effectively wasted.

__Possible Solution:__

One solution would be to offer most subjects as optional. The chosen subjects
should be noted in their final report card.

##### Grating teacher performance

* There is, besides individual feedback, no possible feedback mechanism for teacher
performance.

The teacher is therefore not incentivized to increase performance and can teach however
they want. Most of the time the teacher is also an authoritative figure whose opinion is
not often questioned because of their social status which leads to even less critic.

__Possible Solution:__

Teacher performance could be measured by the number of attendees relative to other classes.
There should also be an anonymous feedback mechanism (online poll) to get around the social
status issue.

### Learning how to learn

* Showing students some ways to attain motivation for the learning of a specific
subject is currently up to the teacher.

This represents a problem because without motivation, self-improvement is impossible.

__Possible Solution:__

If intrinsic motivation is more efficient than we should strive to motivate pupil through
positive emotions which are had in connection with the subject. This will give the task
a better picture in the mind of students which will therefore be the start of the
intrinsic motivational cycle.

This fact should be taught in school and used as a training technique at the same time
so that trying to get around this teaching-mechanism does not reward the hacker with
a feeling of being superior which would discourage anyone from trying.

## Politics and Populism

* Most schools do not currently include any lessons on politics. Therefore,
their common tactics are not considered to be common knowledge.

__Possible Solution:__

We should educate our students about the basic principles of politics. Not
country specific expertise (Like which party does what) but a psychological
view (Like how one is manipulated into voting).

## Communication

* There is currently also very little education about proper communication.

__Possible Solution:__

To solve this a manner of communication should be taught which encourages
mutual respect and listening.

### Open-mindedness

* Open-mindedness is currently no priority in our education system.

Being close minded makes no sense because the person thinking about a solution to a
problem misses out on specific concepts which could be used to fabricate new ideas.
(Because our brain merges existing concepts (inspiration) to something new we call ideas)

__Possible Solution:__

Open-mindedness should be a part of every school culture in every way. With the word
open-mindedness in this context is only meant the listening to new ideas, NOT ACCEPTANCE!

### Fact based discourse

* In all discussion our emotions control the way we communicate or argue.

But this doesn't lead to valuable conclusion when the matter at hand is fact based
and can't be described with emotions.

__Possible Solution:__

Therefore, facts should have a higher priority than emotions in solution oriented
discussions. The value of facts should be taught in a mandatory class on
communication.

### Respectful discussion

* Mutual respect is an important aspect of communication. Without respect discourse
is in most cases not even attempted.

Therefore, any student should have the mental maturity to respect another even
if the position of the "opponent" is seemingly absurd.

__Possible Solution:__

This could be achieved within a mandatory class in which the teacher acts as an
extremist and students could engage in a discussion about the topic at hand.

#### Mistakes

* Mistakes are one of the most shunned aspects of our current society.

Mean spirited critic should have no place in a fact based discussion because it
devalues the other side.

## Problem-Solving

The students should have to practice and improve their problem-solving skills
starting from a young age.

__Expansion needed__

## Our surroundings

* Our current way of mass consumption is a direct product of our "survival instinct".
But capitalism does not limit a lot of the middle class anymore. The limit is now
for consumption now lies with the consumer not with their means.

But they still retain the old reference of wealth (How hard it was to obtain a house).
So status symbols and other worthless spending is preferred to "show off" their
position in life.

To solve this we should practice a minimalistic way of consuming.

__Expansion needed__

## Egotism

### Wealth and Power

* Wealth and power are two of the most uniformly accepted goals of any human
society and individual in a first world country.

We should eliminate joint goals like the drive for wealth and power by not
only changing laws around it but also the mentality of people, which is
important for the self-sustained nature of this property.

This should remove the need for the traditional social hierarchy, which
should counteract inequality somewhat.

__Possible Solution:__

Instead of the traditional "goals of life" students should be taught how to
find their personal meaning of life. But this would probably not work for any
of the students which are not as well of as others because they have to worry
about getting by.




# Organized religion & Belief

## Belief

* Religions fabricate a non-factual worldview in people.

This worldview can easily spread like a virus because the barrier of entry
is so low. One does not have to understand unbiased proof but just belief what
someone claimed.

__Possible Solution:__

Religion should not be actively suppressed because otherwise there is going to
be a counter-movement which could lead to conflict.

Instead, pupils should be taught how religions operate (make money, misuse
psychological phenomena to their advantage). They need to be able to see for
themselves that religions should not have any place in an ever advancing society.

Moreover, the state should also focus on the problem of mental health by
building infrastructure focusing on treatment and research.

Another thing of importance is the communication of sciences which shapes the opinions
of normal people, which needs to be improved greatly.

## Institutionalized religions & Cults

* Organized religions use their belief system combined with psychological
phenomena to their advantage.

__Possible Solution:__

The removal of the belief system will probably mark the end of any
institutionalized belief.

### Keeping believers in

* All of these institutions use a vicious cycle with one or more components
to keep their members in check. Some of these elements are listed here.

#### Belief vs. Proof

* The people learn from preachers (or other higher ups) not to question the
authority and to "believe" instead of verifying claims and testing "truths"
for them self's. The enforcement of this concept is also propagated down to
other members at lower levels of the hierarchy through peer pressure.

#### Simplicity

* These types of religions give a false sense of hope through giving simple
answers to complex questions.

A good example is the life after death.

#### Different thinking

* Thinking differently is considered by most members of these groups to be a bad trait.
Removing and shunning a different way of thinking relative to their religion
improves obedience but obstructs creative thinking.

#### Unprovability

* A lot of beliefs are also simply unprovable with the technology of our time.

**Glossary**:
Religion:
* The service and worship of God or the supernatural
* A personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes,
beliefs, and practices





# State & Law

* Currently, a lot of first world states implement some for of direct or indirect
democracy.

## Polarization 

* The problem is that decisions which should be made with numerical analysis
are instead politicized which creates further divide between people.

This creates another problem because most people are not experts in the matter
in which they have the opportunity to vote, therefore leaving room for the
creation of a degraded solution.

__Possible Solution:__

The solution could be a mix between direct and indirect democracy and a governing body
consisting of scientific experts. Both sides should have a weighted say in every discussion.

The Government is made up of two governing bodies. 

The political side which is voted and then repeatedly asks the public for their opinions
on emotional matters. This side should have more say in emotional matters (70%).

The other side which consists of a few experts per scientific research field
is voted by all scholars in these specific fields (So a quantum physics scholar votes for
others with the same research field). This part should also periodically ask all scholars
on their opinions. This side should have more say in logical matters (70%).

The decision if a matter is logical or emotional is made by sides with equal ranking.
If a topic can be quantized it should be logical and all else are emotional.

## Transparency

* At the time of writing this, most governments implement some form of transparency. 
Be it through recorded congress meetings or other means.

__Expansion needed__

## Companies

### Taxation

* Most tax laws are pretty complicated with multiple taxes applying to different metrics
of a company.

The problem with multiple taxation methods all applied to a single company is that 
it gets complicated to test all corner-cases, which allows more room for potential loopholes.

__Possible Solution:__ 
A single tax which rises exponentially with company size. This would prevent any company from
reaching the state of a monopoly and would help small startups with a tax reduction.

The size of a company should probably be a combined factor of workforce, equity and cash throughput.

__Expansion needed__

## Ads

* At the moment adverts use emotions and facts to convince a consumer to buy.

This leaves multiple avenues open for manipulation because most consumers
are not aware of the intentional use of specific languages (z.b. body language, background music, ...)
to associate a product with an emotion.

__Possible Solution:__

All ads in this country are only able to use facts to represent their products.

## Value

### Types

* Value is usually split into two groups, materialistic and ideological.

The problem with this handling of value is that no empirical measurement
of personal value exists.

__Possible Solution:__

Personal value can not be used as a reliable measure because it has to come
from the interpretation of a person, therefore no laws should exist on the
basis of ideological values.

__Expansion needed__




# Culture & Art

__Expansion needed__

## Arts

* Art is one of the most important aspects of any society.

### The definition of art

* Arts have become oversaturated with the capitalist mode of operation.
What is and is not art should neither be dictated by a price tag nor a guess
by any art connoisseur.

__Possible Solution:__

Instead, anything that incorporates creativity and effort can be art. But art
should not have any value by its self but rather be valued only by the costs
which are needed to produce it.

__Expansion needed__

#### The value of ideas

* Ideas are made exclusive through society. Patents and Copyright just
to name a few.

This can lead to huge monopolies which are centered around only a few
ideas of which they dominate the market.

__Possible Solution:__
Ideas should only be protectable through keeping them a secret. Which is the
most basic form of exclusivity but one that will probably never be completely
eradicated.
