# Education
Currently a lot of schools and teachers encourage the learning of facts and
facts only. This is problematic because these people do not learn how to use
and manipulate things using these facts. They are just taught that this
knowledge exists and that you should remember it for the next test.

```
It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry;
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need
of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.

To facilitate the new way of thinking one must ponder about how to educate the
youth to respect each other and think openly and freely about their
surroundings and ideas.

## Learning performance
Learning new things even outside of school should be rewarded and not punished.

### Students interested
Currently most countries implement some form of standardization for learning
progress and the testing of learned knowledge. This effectively cripples
students who want to go beyond the curriculum because the time, which could
be used for intrinsically motivated learning, is instead filled with
repetitive and outdated learning methods.

__Possible Solution:__
To solve this the teacher should be able to identify a student interested
in learning more than the curriculum covers and who is intrinsically motivated.
This student should have the opportunity to skip classes which teach knowledge
that the pupil already possesses. But this opportunity should only be given
if he passed all tests in the subject in question.

### Students *not* interested
The standardization coupled with coarse-grained grade systems further
introduces another problem which is the suppression of real performance of a student.

A good example of this behavior is when a student gets a nearly negative
grade in a specific subject but still passes the year. Using a peer
review performance test one would be able to assess that the student
is not able to solve basic tasks with the knowledge gained from the
subject but still passed the year.

This leads to a worse overall performance in the workplace if the specific
skill learned in the subject has to be used.

__Possible Solution:__
One solution would be to offer most subjects as optional. The chosen subjects
should be noted in their final report card. Of course
the age at which this freedom is given should be considered because a student
could still be in a phase where he/she is not able to make accurate
judgements about his/her future.

### Learning how to learn


## Populism
We should educate our students about the sighs of a populist and how to deal
with them.

__Possible Solution:__
One solution would be to simply ignore their claims. This should mitigate
most effects of the standard populist method.

But there is a possibility that this will develop into a "Cat and Mouse game"
so the taught methods should grow with new populist tactics.

## Communication
A manner of communication should be taught which encourages the following goals.

### Open-mindedness
The youth needs to be taught to be open-minded and not ignore the point of
view of another person just because it does not align with their world view.

They have to understand that the more "world views" one understands the better
the solution to a given problem is.

Only if this cultural shift happens will we be able to listen to each other in
a discussion even if the members views have almost nothing in common without
having the discourse descend into utter chaos. This can help others build
upon at first seemingly absurd ideas which could potentially accelerate innovation.

__Possible Solution:__
There would need to be a change from embracing and nurturing closed-mindedness
to actively shunning it. However, this would require either an almost dictatorial
style of brainwashing because parents are still an influential source of the
personality traits of a student or even the student's kids (multiple generations).

### Fact based discourse
Facts should have a higher priority than emotions in solution oriented discussions.

### Respectful discussion
One should respect another even if the position of the "opponent" is seemingly absurd.

### Challenging of opinions
One should not only be able to challenge other opinions but also his/her own.
Only then will he/she be able to not only change other opinions but also his/her
own.

## Problem-Solving
The students should have to practice and improve their problem-solving skills
starting from a young age.

__Expansion needed__

## Our surroundings
We should practice a minimalistic way of consuming.

The capitalistic mindset which says that if you have the money you are allowed
to consume is the cancer of modern society. This change was probably led
by an increasing middle class in developed countries where people were not
bound by their means but only by their instincts.

__Possible Solution:__
The survival instinct dictates dominance, therefore a human following this
drive will do (or purchase) anything to reach this goal. Because of that
we should teach our students to disrespect and deal with this sometimes
outdated sense in our modern society.

__Expansion needed__

## Egotism
### Wealth and Power
We should eliminate joint goals like the drive for wealth and power by not
only changing laws around it but also the mentality of people, which is
important for the self-sustained nature of this property.

This should remove the need for the traditional social hierarchy, which
should counteract inequality somewhat.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead of the traditional "goals of life" students should be taught how to
find their personal meaning of life.


# Organized religion & Belief
## Belief
Religions fabricate a non-factual worldview in people.
This can happen because the barrier of entry is not understanding unbiased
proof but just belief. Belief is also way easier because one doesn't have to
think (or use up resources to prove something) but merely follow and repeat.
It therefore plays into the survival instinct (specifically the conservation of energy).

__Possible Solution:__
Religion should not be actively suppressed because otherwise there is going to
be a countermovement which could lead to conflict. Instead, pupils should be
taught how religions operate (make money, misuse psychological phenomena to
their advantage). They need to be able to see for themselves that religion
should not have any place in an ever advancing society.

Moreover, the state should also focus on the problem of mental health by
building infrastructure focusing on treatment and research. Another thing
that is important is the communication of sciences which shapes the opinions
of normal people, which needs to be improved.

__Possible Solution:__
Disproving a hole religion will probably stay impossible for ever because
we use religions to describe something we currently know nothing about.
And there will always be some unexplainable phenomena.

## Institutionalized religions & Cults
Organized religions use their belief system combined with psychological
phenomena to their advantage.

__Possible Solution:__
The removal of the belief system will probably mark the end of any
institutionalized belief.

### Keeping believers in
All of these institutions use a vicious cycle with one or more components
to keep their members in check. Some of these elements are listed here.

#### Belief vs. Proof
The people learn from preachers (or other higher ups) not to question the
authority and to "believe" instead of verifying claims and testing "truths"
for them self's. The enforcement of this concept is also propagated down to
other members at lower levels of the hierarchy through peer pressure.

#### Simplicity
These types of religions give a false sense of hope through giving simple
answers to complex questions.

A good example is the life after death.

#### Different thinking
Thinking differently is considered by most members of these groups to be a bad trait.
Removing and shunning a different way of thinking relative to their religion
improves obedience but obstructs creative thinking.

#### Unprovability
A lot of beliefs are also simply unprovable with the technology of our time.


# Arts
## The definition of art
Arts have become oversaturated with the capitalist mode of operation.
What is and is not art should neither be dictated by a price tag nor a guess
by any art connoisseur.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead anything that incorporates creativity and effort can be art.

__Expansion needed__


# Value
Value is usually split into two groups, materialistic and ideological.
The problem with this handling of value is that no empirical messurement 
of personal value exists.

__Possible Solution:__
Personal value can not be used as a reliable measure because it has to come
from the interpretation of a person, therefore no laws should exist on the
basis of ideological values.
