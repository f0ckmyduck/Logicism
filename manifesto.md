# Education

* Most are taught in a way where knowledge is something that doesn't have to be understood
but can simply be attained.

```
It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry;
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need
of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.

The goal of this paragraph about education is to give students the opportunity to
learn intrinsically and in a fun way about topics that they want without the added bloat.
The other intent is to give them the power to transmit or discuss their knowledge with
others in a purely knowledge based discourse.

## Learning performance

* Learning in a different way or at a different pace is currently punished
passively by the move to standardized education systems.

### Differing cases

#### Faster learning pace

* Students with a faster learning pace are often underwhelmed by the tasks they
are given. The handling of these corner-cases also greatly depends on the
personality of a teacher and the student-teacher relationship.

__Possible Solution:__
Students should have the option to only take the exam but not to have mandatory
attendance at a classroom if their grades are in the upper range.

#### Uninterested courses

* In Austria for example there are most of the time no optional courses or
classes except in university.

This is a problem because if a class is not interesting the learning performance
of this student will go down. And if the performance sinks to a minimum the time
spent in class is effectively wasted.

__Possible Solution:__
One solution would be to offer most subjects as optional. The chosen subjects
should be noted in their final report card.

### Learning how to learn

* Showing students some ways to attain motivation for the learning of a specific
subject is currently up to the teacher.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead this should be delivered in a small and mandatory lesson.

## Politics and Populism

* Most schools do not currently include any lessons on politics. Therefore
their common tactics are not considered to be common knowledge.

__Possible Solution:__
We should educate our students about the basic principals of politics. Not
country specific expertise (Like which party does what) but a psychological
view (Like how one is manipulated into voting).

## Communication

* There is currently also very little education about proper communication.

__Possible Solution:__
To solve this a manner of communication should be taught which encourages
the following goals.

The end goal of this class on communication is that every member should
have the mental maturity and communication techniques to come to either
a compromise, consensus or best case a common conclusion in a fact based
discussion.

### Open-mindedness

* Open-mindedness is currently no priority in our education system.

But the youth needs to be taught to be open-minded to effectively communicate
with each other. The receptiveness to new ideas is especially important when considering
creative work (There it is often called inspiration).

__Possible Solution:__
This trait should also be teached in a mandatory class because inspiration is needed
when creating new ideas (given how our brain merges concepts to something new
we call ideas).

### Fact based discourse

* In all discussion our emotions control the way we communicate or argue.

But this doesn't lead to valuable conclusion when the matter at hand is fact based
and can't be described with emotions.

__Possible Solution:__
Therefore facts should have a higher priority than emotions in solution oriented
discussions. The value of facts should be taught in a mandatory class on
communication as well.

### Respectful discussion

* Mutual respect is an important aspect of communication. Without respect discourse
is in most cases not even attempted.

Therefore any student should have the mental maturity to respect another even
if the position of the "opponent" is seemingly absurd.

__Possible Solution:__
This could be achieved within a mandatory class in which the teacher acts as an
extremist and students could engage in a discussion about the topic at hand.

#### Mistakes

* Mistakes are one of the most shunned aspects of our current society.

Mean spirited critic should have no place in a fact based discussion because it
devalues the other side.

### Challenging of opinions and honesty

* Opinions are valued (some are worth more than others) in our society which hinders
an equal discussion (where everyone is equal).

Some are so highly ranked that no one dares to challenge them.
These could in part be traced back to either the authority bias or the courtesy bias.

Therefore one should not only be able to challenge other opinions but also his/her own
while also being honest about them.

## Problem-Solving

The students should have to practice and improve their problem-solving skills
starting from a young age.

__Expansion needed__

## Our surroundings

* Our current way of mass consumption is a direct product of our "survival instinct".
But capitalism does not limit a lot of the middle class any more. The limit is now
for consumption now lies with the consumer not with their means.

But they still retain the old reference of wealth (How hard it was to obtain a house).
So status symbols and other worthless spending is preferred to "show off" their
position in life.

To solve this we should practice a minimalistic way of consuming.

__Expansion needed__

## Egotism

### Wealth and Power

* Wealth and power are two of the most uniformly accepted goals of any human
society and individual in a first world country.

We should eliminate joint goals like the drive for wealth and power by not
only changing laws around it but also the mentality of people, which is
important for the self-sustained nature of this property.

This should remove the need for the traditional social hierarchy, which
should counteract inequality somewhat.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead of the traditional "goals of life" students should be taught how to
find their personal meaning of life.

# Organized religion & Belief

## Belief

* Religions fabricate a non-factual worldview in people.

This worldview can easily spread like a virus because the barrier of entry
is so low. One does not have to understand unbiased proof but just belief what
someone claimed.

__Possible Solution:__
Religion should not be actively suppressed because otherwise there is going to
be a counter-movement which could lead to conflict.

Instead, pupils should be taught how religions operate (make money, misuse
psychological phenomena to their advantage). They need to be able to see for
themselves that religions should not have any place in an ever advancing society.

Moreover, the state should also focus on the problem of mental health by
building infrastructure focusing on treatment and research.

Another thing of importance is the communication of sciences which shapes the opinions
of normal people, which needs to be improved greatly.

## Institutionalized religions & Cults

* Organized religions use their belief system combined with psychological
phenomena to their advantage.

__Possible Solution:__
The removal of the belief system will probably mark the end of any
institutionalized belief.

### Keeping believers in

* All of these institutions use a vicious cycle with one or more components
to keep their members in check. Some of these elements are listed here.

#### Belief vs. Proof

* The people learn from preachers (or other higher ups) not to question the
authority and to "believe" instead of verifying claims and testing "truths"
for them self's. The enforcement of this concept is also propagated down to
other members at lower levels of the hierarchy through peer pressure.

#### Simplicity

* These types of religions give a false sense of hope through giving simple
answers to complex questions.

A good example is the life after death.

#### Different thinking

* Thinking differently is considered by most members of these groups to be a bad trait.
Removing and shunning a different way of thinking relative to their religion
improves obedience but obstructs creative thinking.

#### Unprovability

* A lot of beliefs are also simply unprovable with the technology of our time.

# State

## Arts

### The definition of art

* Arts have become oversaturated with the capitalist mode of operation.
What is and is not art should neither be dictated by a price tag nor a guess
by any art connoisseur.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead anything that incorporates creativity and effort can be art.

__Expansion needed__

## Value

* Value is usually split into two groups, materialistic and ideological.

The problem with this handling of value is that no empirical measurement
of personal value exists.

__Possible Solution:__
Personal value can not be used as a reliable measure because it has to come
from the interpretation of a person, therefore no laws should exist on the
basis of ideological values.
