# Schooling
Currently a lot of schools and teachers encourage the learning of facts and facts only. This is problematic because these people
do not learn how to use and manipulate things using these facts. They are just taught that this knowledge exists and that you should remember it
for the next test.

```
It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry;
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.

To facilitate the new way of thinking one must ponder about how to educate the youth to respect each other and think openly and
freely about their surroundings and ideas.

## Learning performance
Learning new things even outside of school should be rewarded and not punished.

#### Students interested in the subject
Currently most countries implement some form of standardization for learning progress and the testing of learned knowledge.
This effectively cripples students who want to go beyond the curriculum because the time, which could be used for intrinsicaly motivated learning,
is instead filled with repetitive and outdated learning methods.

__Possible Solution:__
To solve this the teacher should be able to identify a student interested in learning more than the curriculum covers and who is intrinsically motivated.
This student should have the opportunity to skip classes which teach knowledge that the pupil already possesses. But this opportunity should only be given
if he passed all tests in the subject in question.

#### Students *not* interested in the subject
The standardization coupled with coarse-grained grade systems further introduces another problem which is the suppression of real performance of a student.

A good example of this behaviour is when a student gets a nearly negative grade in a specific subject but still passes the year. Using
a peer review performance test one would be able to assess that the student is not able to solve basic tasks with the knowledge gained
from the subject but still passed the year.

This leads to a worse overall performance in the workplace if the specific skill learned in the subject has to be used.

__Possible Solution:__
One solution would be to offer most subjects as optional. The chosen subjects should be noted in their final report card. Of course
the age at which this freedom is given should be considered because a student could still be in a phase where he/she is not able to make
accurate judgements about his/her future.

__Expansion needed__

## Dictatorship (Tyranny, ...)
We should educate our students about the sighs of a populist and how to deal with them.

__Possible Solution:__
One solution would be to simply ignore their claims. This should mitigate most effects of the standard populist method.

But there is a possibility that this will develop into a "Cat and Mouse game" so the taught methods
should grow with new populist tactics.

## Communication
A manner of communication should be taught which encourages the following goals.

#### Open-mindedness
The youth needs to be taught to be open-minded and not ignore the point of view of another person just because it does not align with their world view.

They have to understand that the more "world views" one understands the better the solution to a given problem is.

Only if this cultural shift happens will we be able to listen to each other in a discussion even if the members views have almost nothing in common without
having the discourse descend into utter chaos. This can help others build upon at first seemingly absurd ideas which could potentialy accelerate innovation.

__Possible Solution:__
There would need to be a change from embracing and nurturing closed-mindedness to actively shunning it.
However, this would require either an almost dictatorial style of brainwashing because parents are still an influential source of the
personality traits of a student or even the student's kids (multiple generations).

#### Fact based discourse
Facts should have a higher priority than emotions in solution oriented discussions.

#### Respectful discussion
One should respect another even if the position of the "opponent" is seemingly absurd.

#### Challenging of opinions
One should not only be able to challenge other opinions but also his own.

## Problem-Solving
The students should have to practice and improve their problem-solving skills starting from a young age.


# Our surroundings
We should practice a minimalistic way of consuming.

The capitalistic mindset which says that if you have the money you are allowed to consume is the cancer of modern society.
This change was probably led by an increasing middle class in developed countries where people were not bound by their means but only
by their instincts.

__Possible Solution:__
The survival instinct dictates dominance therefore a human following this drive will do (or purchase) anything to reach this goal.
We should therefore teach our students to disrespect and deal with this sometimes outdated sense.


# Religion
Religions fabricate a non-factual worldview in people.

The people learn not to question the authority and to "believe" instead of verifying claims and testing "truths".
This improves obedience but obstructs creative thinking. Being "different" is considered to be a "bad" trait.
Religion also gives a false sense of hope and (like any movement) a sense of belonging which further strengthens the belief through peer-pressure.

The combination of these factors results in a vicious circle.

__Possible Solution:__
Religion should not be actively suppressed because otherwise there is going to be a countermovement which could lead to conflict.
Instead, pupils should be taught how religions operate (make money, misuse psychological phenomena to their advantage). They need to be able to decide 
for themselves what they choose to believe in.

Moreover, the state should also focus on the problem of mental health by building infrastructure focusing on treatment and research.
Another thing that is important is the communication of sciences which shapes the opinions of normal people, which needs to be improved.


# Arts
## The definition of art
Arts have become oversaturated with the capitalist mode of operation.
What is and is not art should neither be dictated by a price tag nor a guess by any art connoisseur.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead anything that incorporates creativity and effort can be art.


# Value
Value is usualy split into two groups, materialistic and ideological. The problem with this handling of value is that
no empirical messurement of personal value exists.

__Possible Solution:__
Personal value can not be used as a reliable measure because it has to come from the interpretation of a person, therefore no laws should exist on the basis of ideological values.
