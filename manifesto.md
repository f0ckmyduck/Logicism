# Education

Most are taught in a way where knowledge is something that doesn't have to be understood
but can simply be attained.

```
It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry;
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need
of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.

## Learning performance

Learning in a different way or at a different pace is currently punished
passively by the move to standardized education systems.

### Differing cases

#### Faster learning pace

Students with a faster learning pace are often underwhelmed by the tasks they
are given. The handling of these corner-cases also greatly depends on the
personality of a teacher and the student-teacher relationship.

__Possible Solution:__
Students should have the option to only take the exam but not to have mandatory
attendance at a classroom if their grades are in the upper range.

#### Uninterested courses

In Austria there are most of the time no optional courses or classes except in
university.

This is a problem because if a class is not interesting the learning performance
of this student will shrink. And if the performance sinks to a minimum the time
spent in class is effectively wasted.

__Possible Solution:__
One solution would be to offer most subjects as optional. The chosen subjects
should be noted in their final report card.

### Learning how to learn

Showing students some ways to attain motivation for the learning of a specific
subject is currently up to the teacher.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead this should be delivered in a small and mandatory lesson.

## Populism

Most schools do not currently include any lessons on politics. Therefore
their common tactics are not considered to be common knowledge.

__Possible Solution:__
We should educate our students about the basic principals of politics. Not
country specific expertise (Like which party does what) but a psychological
view (Like how one is manipulated).

## Communication

There is currently also very little education about proper communication.

__Possible Solution:__
To solve this a manner of communication should be taught which encourages
the following goals.

### Open-mindedness

The youth needs to be taught to be open-minded and not ignore the point of
view of another person just because it does not align with their world view.

They have to understand that the more "world views" one understands the better
the solution to a given problem is.

Only if this cultural shift happens will we be able to listen to each other in
a discussion even if the members views have almost nothing in common without
having the discourse descend into utter chaos. This can help others build
upon at first seemingly absurd ideas which could potentially accelerate innovation.

__Possible Solution:__
There would need to be a change from embracing and nurturing closed-mindedness
to actively shunning it. However, this would require either an almost dictatorial
style of brainwashing because parents are still an influential source of the
personality traits of a student or even the student's kids (multiple generations).

### Fact based discourse

Facts should have a higher priority than emotions in solution oriented discussions.

### Respectful discussion

One should respect another even if the position of the "opponent" is seemingly absurd.

### Challenging of opinions

One should not only be able to challenge other opinions but also his/her own.
Only then will he/she be able to not only change other opinions but also his/her
own.

## Problem-Solving

The students should have to practice and improve their problem-solving skills
starting from a young age.

__Expansion needed__

## Our surroundings

We should practice a minimalistic way of consuming.

The capitalistic mindset which says that if you have the money you are allowed
to consume is the cancer of modern society. This change was probably led
by an increasing middle class in developed countries where people were not
bound by their means but only by their instincts.

__Possible Solution:__
The survival instinct dictates dominance, therefore a human following this
drive will do (or purchase) anything to reach this goal. Because of that
we should teach our students to disrespect and deal with this sometimes
outdated sense in our modern society.

__Expansion needed__

## Egotism

### Wealth and Power

We should eliminate joint goals like the drive for wealth and power by not
only changing laws around it but also the mentality of people, which is
important for the self-sustained nature of this property.

This should remove the need for the traditional social hierarchy, which
should counteract inequality somewhat.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead of the traditional "goals of life" students should be taught how to
find their personal meaning of life.

# Organized religion & Belief

## Belief

Religions fabricate a non-factual worldview in people.
This can happen because the barrier of entry is not understanding unbiased
proof but just belief. Belief is also way easier because one doesn't have to
think (or use up resources to prove something) but merely follow and repeat.
It therefore plays into the survival instinct (specifically the conservation of energy).

__Possible Solution:__
Religion should not be actively suppressed because otherwise there is going to
be a counter-movement which could lead to conflict. Instead, pupils should be
taught how religions operate (make money, misuse psychological phenomena to
their advantage). They need to be able to see for themselves that religion
should not have any place in an ever advancing society.

Moreover, the state should also focus on the problem of mental health by
building infrastructure focusing on treatment and research. Another thing
that is important is the communication of sciences which shapes the opinions
of normal people, which needs to be improved.

__Possible Solution:__
Disproving a hole religion will probably stay impossible for ever because
we use religions to describe something we currently know nothing about.
And there will always be some unexplainable phenomena.

## Institutionalized religions & Cults

Organized religions use their belief system combined with psychological
phenomena to their advantage.

__Possible Solution:__
The removal of the belief system will probably mark the end of any
institutionalized belief.

### Keeping believers in

All of these institutions use a vicious cycle with one or more components
to keep their members in check. Some of these elements are listed here.

#### Belief vs. Proof

The people learn from preachers (or other higher ups) not to question the
authority and to "believe" instead of verifying claims and testing "truths"
for them self's. The enforcement of this concept is also propagated down to
other members at lower levels of the hierarchy through peer pressure.

#### Simplicity

These types of religions give a false sense of hope through giving simple
answers to complex questions.

A good example is the life after death.

#### Different thinking

Thinking differently is considered by most members of these groups to be a bad trait.
Removing and shunning a different way of thinking relative to their religion
improves obedience but obstructs creative thinking.

#### Unprovability

A lot of beliefs are also simply unprovable with the technology of our time.

# Arts

## The definition of art

Arts have become oversaturated with the capitalist mode of operation.
What is and is not art should neither be dictated by a price tag nor a guess
by any art connoisseur.

__Possible Solution:__
Instead anything that incorporates creativity and effort can be art.

__Expansion needed__

# Value

Value is usually split into two groups, materialistic and ideological.
The problem with this handling of value is that no empirical measurement
of personal value exists.

__Possible Solution:__
Personal value can not be used as a reliable measure because it has to come
from the interpretation of a person, therefore no laws should exist on the
basis of ideological values.
