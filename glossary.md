# General words
## Statement
A statement is usually a paragraph.

## Peer Review Performance Test
A test in which someone is asked questions on paper. These questions are then duplicated and distributed to multiple teachers which give a grating based on
the unified grating system (GPGS). At least half of the teachers should have never meet the student. The scores of each teacher is then averaged to get the final score.

## General Purpose Grade System - GPGS
* The GPGS is a points based system.
* It is a combinational system comprised of negating and adding questions.
* Questions handling essential or basic knowledge should subtract from the maximum points possible of that question for every wrong answer.
* Questions that deal with specifics of a given subject should add points for every right answer.
* Tests should be made in a way where only basic knowledge is not enough to get a positive mark.

__Expansion needed__

The final score is a number between 0 and 1 with at least 5 decimal places.
The score is calculated as such: <points gained> / <maximum points> = <score>

The combinational nature should counteract teacher biasing and give the student the opportunity to show
necessary additional skills through the additive behaviour.

## Mathematical operators
