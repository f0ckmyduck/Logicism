# General words
## Statement
A statement is usually a paragraph.

## Peer Review Performance Test
A test in which someone is asked questions on paper. These questions are then
duplicated and distributed to multiple teachers which give a grading based on
the unified grading system (GPGS). At least half of the teachers should have
never met the student. The scores of each teacher are then averaged to get
the final score.

## General Purpose Grade System - GPGS
* The GPGS is a points based system.
* It is a combinational system comprised of negating and adding questions.
* Questions handling essential or basic knowledge should subtract from the
maximum points possible of that question for every wrong answer.
* Questions that deal with specifics of a given subject should add points for
every right answer.
* Tests should be made in a way where only basic knowledge is not enough to get
a positive mark.

__Expansion needed__

The final score is a number between 0 and 1 with at least 5 decimal places.

The score is calculated as such: `<points gained> / <maximum points> = <score>`

The combinational nature should counteract teacher biasing and give the
student the opportunity to show necessary additional skills through the
additive behavior.

## Mathematical operators
All mathematical operators are taken from the C language.

## Religion
* The service and worship of God or the supernatural
* A personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes,
beliefs, and practices
